Hello, My name is Ashwini Pisal. I am a graduate student at Georgia State University,Atlanta Georgia. I will be graduating summer-2019.
I am working as Graduate Research Asssitant in Learning and Developement department under Dr.Kim. We are working on Student Mental Model Analyzer for Research and Teaching Support (SMART).Technology to Support In-Classroom Adaptive Problem-Centered Learning.

The SMART technology combines the effectiveness of a human tutor and the speed provided by technology to bring forth a smart way for the teachers in gaining the information of all the students’ understanding and performance. SMART is a web-based platform for evaluating the performance of a student and provide the feedback for improvement. This technology contains two important components which form the core logic 1) ‘natural language processing’ to extract concept maps from texts and 2)‘social network analysis’ to analyze the graph  constructed from the concept maps. The instructor provides expert models to compare with the student responses for a problem statement. Various metrics are used to extract similarity measures between the two models for evaluation. It also facilitates the researchers with the information on learning curves and performance of students as individuals or as a group at class level.

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
