Hello, My name is Ashwini Pisal. I am a graduate student at Georgia State University,Atlanta Georgia. My studies and research focuses on Machine Learning and Data science. Currently I am working as Graduate Research Asssitant in Learning and Developement department under Dr.Kim. We are working on Student Mental Model Analyzer for Research and Teaching Support (SMART).A system to support in-classroom adaptive problem-centered learning.

The SMART technology combines the effectiveness of a human tutor and the speed provided by technology to bring forth a smart way for the teachers in gaining the information of all the students’ understanding and performance. SMART is a web-based platform for evaluating the performance of a student and provide the feedback for improvement. This technology contains two important components which form the core logic 1) ‘natural language processing’ to extract concept maps from texts and 2)‘social network analysis’ to analyze the graph  constructed from the concept maps. The instructor provides expert models to compare with the student responses for a problem statement. Various metrics are used to extract similarity measures between the two models for evaluation. It also facilitates the researchers with the information on learning curves and performance of students as individuals or as a group at class level. I am working on devlopment ,ehancements, bug fixning and documentation of the SMART.

During summer-2018, I did internship at AdvancedMD healthercare company. I worked as software developement Intern. I was part of electronic daat interchange team where we used to maintain patients insurance details. During my intership I worked on patients insrance eligibility module. I had created selenium script which will extract the patients details from patients insurance portal and will represent that information as a report. I had implemnetated this functionality as web serice and integrated with practice management software for easy access to patients insurance eligibility details.

Before masters I was working as Senior software engineer at BNP Paribas Pvt. Ltd Mumbai India.My area of interest involves Machine Learning and Software Development. During my course I have worked on Neural netwrok project "Emotion recognition using facial expression". I had developed a convolution neural network in python using Keras Libarary. I am experienced on big data technologies Hadoop Map-Reduce and Spark. I have clear understanding and knowledge on Data mining and Machine learning algorithms and usages. 

My techical skill set involves:
•	Languages: Java, .Net (C#, WCF, ASP.net), Python (NumPy, Pandas), R
•	Database Systems: SQL Server, MySQL
•	Cloud Services: Amazon web services(AWS)
•	Reporting tool: Tableau
•	Code Version Tools: SVN, Microsoft TFS
•	CICD Tool: Jira
